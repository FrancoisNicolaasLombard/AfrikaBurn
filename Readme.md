# AfrikaBurn Interactive Booking Map
## Progress
- First used Aptana Studio to try and solve the problem of using html, JS, and CSS. The given code was difficult to understand
and was unorganised. Therefore, it was decided to rather restart the project based on JavaFX, FXML, and CSS.
- A web-based program does not have direct access to files on the computer and leads to a frustrating and redundant process of
having to specify the files whilst using the program.
- The Netbeans IDE is used rather than IntelliJ, because IntelliJ's free version does not support CSS and does not implement 
code-completion.
- Scene Builder was installed alongside Netbeans to design the GUI and Netbeans was used for the logic.
- The latitude and lonitude co-ordinates are read from a JSON files and then converted to cartesian.
- Implemented features to make the program more user-friendly.
## Problems Encountered
- The map is warped and a better approximation is needed to ensure better area calculations.
- The layering is buggy (snapping to front-area).
## TODO
- Improve snapping of bookings to compensate for more intuitive areas.
